        <p>
            Our story began long ago in Athens,
            where we had set up our first restaurant.
            The very first Thai cuisine that Athens has ever experienced.
            At first, like all businesses, it was little to no attention was
            given. That is until a weary traveler came along to first sample our food.
            This traveler stated it was a flavor unlike anything he had experienced within his time.
            Little did we know that this traveler was Aristophanes the most famous comic playwrighter Athen's has homed.
            Afterward he had held shows telling all the people how they should try this exotic and delightful tasting
            food.
